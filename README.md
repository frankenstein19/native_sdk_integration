## Overview

The `native_sdk_integration` project showcases the seamless integration of native components with Flutter applications. It illustrates how to render native layouts inside a Flutter app and establishes communication channels to interact with native code using events and method channels.

## Features

- **Native Layout Rendering:** Display native UI components within Flutter widgets.
- **Event Communication:** Send events from native code to Flutter for real-time updates.
- **Method Channel:** Invoke native methods from Flutter and receive responses.

## Technologies Used

- ![Flutter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flutter-02569B?style=flat-square&logo=flutter&logoColor=white) Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- ![Android](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android-3DDC84?style=flat-square&logo=android&logoColor=white) Android native platform for building mobile applications.
- ![iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/iOS-000000?style=flat-square&logo=ios&logoColor=white) iOS native platform for building mobile applications.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd native_sdk_integration
``


2. To run the project, follow these steps:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Getting Started

Explore the `native_layouts` folder to find native UI components for Android and iOS. Check the following files for Flutter-to-Native communication examples:

- `method_channel.dart`: Demonstrates invoking methods in native code and receiving responses asynchronously.
- `event_channel.dart`: Shows how native code can send events to Flutter for real-time updates.

Modify and extend native components to fit your project's requirements.

## Communication Channels

### Method Channel

The method channel allows Flutter to invoke methods in native code and receive responses asynchronously. See `method_channel.dart` for implementation details.

### Event Channel

The event channel enables native code to send events to Flutter for real-time updates. See `event_channel.dart` for implementation details.
